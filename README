git-rebase-diff
===============

a tiny wrapper around git range-diff,
to make it easy to use after performing a rebase
(or multiple rebases, as long as you haven't pushed to a remote branch yet).

esp useful if encountered merge conflicts
& want to verify that nothing screwed up.

setup
-----

```
git clone https://github.com/kiprasmel/git-rebase-diff.git
# or:  git clone git@github.com:kiprasmel/git-rebase-diff.git

cd git-rebase-diff
cp git-rebase-diff /usr/local/bin/

# optional alias
git config --global alias.rd rebase-diff
```

usage
-----

expects that you:
- are checked out in the branch you rebased
	- the branch has a remote counterpart

```
git-rebase-diff
git-rebase-diff [options]...
git-rebase-diff -- [range-diff args]...
```

viewing a previous rebase diff
------------------------------

git-rebase-diff --nth 0   # current (no effect)
git-rebase-diff --nth 1   # 1st previous
git-rebase-diff -x    5   # 5th previous
git-rebase-diff -x    max # very last

viewing an interval of grouped rebase-diffs
viewing multiple (grouped) rebase-diffs
---------------------------------------




behavior
--------

essentially does:

```
old=@{u}
new=@
base=$(git merge-base $old $new)
git range-diff $base..$old $base..$new
```

but if $old == $new, then nothing would show up,
thus we show the previous range-diff by changing $old to @{u}@{1}
